# Bible Translation Helper â€” Word Add-in

This is a Microsoft Word add-in designed to **assist Bible translators**.  
It processes USFM/USX resources and builds structured JSON files:

- **bible.json** â†’ parsed Bible content
- **verse_index.json** â†’ fast verse lookup

The add-in displays three kinds of helps for translators:

1. **Information** â€” explains words, names, places, and cultural background.  
2. **Notes** â€” short detailed observations for clarity.  
3. **Suggestions** â€” simple and plain translation options.

### âœ… Features
- Reads USFM/USX files from multiple resources (e.g., NIV84, GNT, T4T, HBKENG, TND, TNN, NLT).  
- Generates JSON for use inside Microsoft Word.  
- Helps Mother Tongue Translators (MTTs) by providing easy-to-understand notes.  
- Works with both test files and full resource sets (when permissions allow).
